This track is not in the original _Mezzanine_ album (1998), but is included in an upcoming _Mezzanine_ reissue along with several other previously unreleased Mad Professor remixes.

I once saw Lee "Scratch" Perry and Mad Professor in a tiny club in a small student town in France out of pure coincidence (#randombrag). Not being a dub/jungle fan, I had no idea who Mad Professor was. My late friend, a DJ who mainly played this type of music, told me who he was. So I'm now dancing to his memory.
